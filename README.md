# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Space

## About Me
I'm Hossein, a versatile and passionate tech enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for all things software. My journey through code has taken me from machine learning research to full-stack development, and I’m always looking for the next project that’ll push the boundaries of innovation.

🚀 Whether it's building cutting-edge applications, training deep learning models, or crafting clean and scalable code, I’m all in. My work spans from academic research to hands-on industry projects, and each experience has helped me level up my coding game and share impactful tech solutions.

Outside of coding, I'm always up for a chat about tech trends, a competitive game of soccer, or diving deep into how AI can shape the future of health and engineering.
